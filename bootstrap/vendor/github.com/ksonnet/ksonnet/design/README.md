# Design Documents

This directory contains a set of design documents that describe the design and
implementation of the ksonnet toolchain. This includes not only the ksonnet CLI
tool, but all the surrounding tooling as well, such as the language server, the
core libraries, _etc_.

As significant feature work will be accompanied by design documents,
this directory is a living representation of the ksonnet toolchain.

## CLI

* [`ks registry update` and `ks registry delete`](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/tree/master/design/proposals/ks-registry-update-delete.md)
* [Improve the "fresh clone" story](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/tree/master/design/proposals/fresh-clone.md)
* [Explicit environment metadata](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/tree/master/design/proposals/explicit-environment-metadata.md)
