## ks registry add

Add a registry to the current ksonnet app

### Synopsis


The `add` command allows custom registries to be added to your ksonnet app,
provided that their file structures follow the appropriate schema. *You can look
at the `incubator` repo (https://github.com/ksonnet/parts/tree/master/incubator)
as an example.*

A registry is uniquely identified by its:

1. Name (e.g. `incubator`)
2. Version (e.g. `master`)

There are two supported registry protocols: **github** and **fs**.

GitHub registries expect a path in a GitHub repository, and filesystem based
registries expect a path on the local filesystem.

During creation, all registries must specify a unique name and URI where the
registry lives. Optionally, a version can be provided (e.g. the *Github branch
name*). If a version is not specified, it will default to `latest`.

Registries can be overridden with `--override`.  Overridden registries
are stored in `app.override.yaml` and can be safely ignored using your
SCM configuration.
